Once upon a time there was an ant named Thum. He lived in am ant hill in 
Alaska during the 80's. He ate food for a living and he lived happliy ever
after.

After Thum's death, his son Thumson gets Thum's house.
Thumson now lives in am ant hill in Alaska during the 80's.
He eats food for a living and he will live happily ever after like his father did.

Thumson's ant hill had a nice fireplace and a library full of ant books.  It had a 
big kitchen and many bedrooms.  He hired a termite to help with gardening and had a 
flea butler.

Then Thumson died, and his son, Thumsonson, took over his ant estate. It was now
Alaska in the 90's. He and his staff lived happily ever after.
